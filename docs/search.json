    "section": "2. Data and Methodology",
    "text": "2. Data and Methodology\n\n2.1 Data Source\nThe data were scraped from the NHL API and include player in-season statistics from the 2000–2001 through 2024–2025 seasons. Each season is treated independently, meaning that a player appearing in multiple seasons is recorded as a separate observation for each season.\nThe dataset includes skaters only (goalies are excluded) and contains metrics specific to player position. Positions are categorized as\n\nCenters (C): primarily takes faceoffs, plays both offense and defense\nLeft Wings (L) and Right Wings (R): primarily offensive roles, responsible for scoring and assisting.\nDefensemen (D): primarily defensive, preventing opponents from scoring\n\n\n\n2.2 Metric Definitions\nMetrics are divided into two categories: counting metrics and percentage (rate-based) metrics. Definitions are provided below for clarity.\n\nCounting Metrics\n\nGoals (G):\nThe total number of goals scored by a player during a season.\nAssists (A):\nThe total number of assists recorded by a player, including both primary and secondary assists.\nPoints (P):\nThe sum of goals and assists (P = G + A). This metric captures overall offensive contribution.\nShots (S):\nThe total number of shots on goal taken by a player.\nPenalty Minutes (PIM):\nThe total number of minutes a player spends penalized. Higher values may reflect physical play, but can also indicate discipline issues. Penalty minutes is also different from the rest of the metrics in that a higher value is to be considered worse.\nPlus/Minus (+/−):\nA measure of on-ice goal differential. A player receives:\n\n+1 when on the ice for a goal scored by their team, and\n−1 when on the ice for a goal scored by the opposing team.\nThis metric serves as a rough indicator of two-way impact but is influenced by team context.\n\n\n\n\nPercentage Metrics\n\nShooting Percentage (S%):\nThe percentage of shots on goal that result in goals, calculated as: \\([\n\\text{Shooting Percentage} = \\frac{\\text{Goals}}{\\text{Shots}} \\times 100\\)] This metric reflects scoring efficiency rather than shot volume.\nFaceoff Win Percentage (FOW%):\nproportion of faceoffs won by the player. Particularly relevant for centers, as they primarily take faceoffs. Winning a faceoff gives your team possession and a chance to score.\n\n\n\n\n2.3 Handling Missing Values\nFor each metric group, players with missing values are removed only for that specific analysis. This ensures that:\n\nFaceoff metrics are not distorted by non-centers, and\nShooting percentage is calculated only where meaningful.\n\nThis approach preserves as much data as possible while maintaining valid comparisons.\n\n\n2.4 Definition of the Performance Gap\nAll reported gaps are calculated as:\n\nUtah Mammoth median − League median\n\nPositive values indicate Utah players outperform the league median, while negative values indicate underperformance. For Penalty Minutes, interpretation differs, as higher values may reflect either physical play or increased time spent penalized."
