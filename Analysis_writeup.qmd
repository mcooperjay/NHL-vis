## 1. Introduction

This analysis evaluates the on-ice performance of the **Utah Mammoth (UTA)** relative to the rest of the NHL using player-level data. The objective is to identify areas where Utah outperforms or underperforms league norms, with a focus on both counting statistics (e.g., goals, shots) and rate-based or percentage metrics (e.g., shooting percentage, faceoff win percentage).

From a roster-building perspective, identifying areas of underperformance can provide insight into positional needs and potential targets for drafting or trades. All comparisons are made using **median values**, which reduces the influence of outliers and better reflects the typical player contribution.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. Data and Methodology

### 2.1 Data Source

The data were scraped from the NHL API and include player in-season statistics from the **2000–2001 through 2024–2025 seasons**. Each season is treated independently, meaning that a player appearing in multiple seasons is recorded as a separate observation for each season.

The dataset includes **skaters only** (goalies are excluded) and contains metrics specific to player position. Positions are categorized as **Centers (C), Left Wings (L), Right Wings (R), and Defensemen (D)**.

### 2.2 Metric Definitions

Metrics are divided into two categories: **counting metrics** and **percentage (rate-based) metrics**. Definitions are provided below for clarity.

#### Counting Metrics

- **Goals (G):**  
  The total number of goals scored by a player during a season.

- **Assists (A):**  
  The total number of assists recorded by a player, including both primary and secondary assists.

- **Points (P):**  
  The sum of goals and assists (*P = G + A*). This metric captures overall offensive contribution.

- **Shots (S):**  
  The total number of shots on goal taken by a player.

- **Penalty Minutes (PIM):**  
  The total number of minutes a player spends penalized. Higher values may reflect physical play, but can also indicate discipline issues.

- **Plus/Minus (+/−):**  
  A measure of on-ice goal differential. A player receives:
  - **+1** when on the ice for a goal scored by their team, and
  - **−1** when on the ice for a goal scored by the opposing team.  
  This metric serves as a rough indicator of two-way impact but is influenced by team context.

#### Percentage Metrics

- **Shooting Percentage (S%):**  
  The percentage of shots on goal that result in goals, calculated as:
  \[
  \text{Shooting Percentage} = \frac{\text{Goals}}{\text{Shots}} \times 100
  \]
  This metric reflects scoring efficiency rather than shot volume.

- **Faceoff Win Percentage (FOW%):**  
  The percentage of faceoffs won by a player. This metric is primarily relevant for centers, who take the majority of faceoffs.

### 2.3 Handling Missing Values

For each metric group, players with missing values are removed **only for that specific analysis**. This ensures that:
- Faceoff metrics are not distorted by non-centers, and
- Shooting percentage is calculated only where meaningful.

This approach preserves as much data as possible while maintaining valid comparisons.

### 2.4 Definition of the Performance Gap

All reported gaps are calculated as:

> **Utah Mammoth median − League median**

Positive values indicate Utah players outperform the league median, while negative values indicate underperformance. For **Penalty Minutes**, interpretation differs, as higher values may reflect either physical play or increased time spent penalized.

## 3. Team-Level Comparison: Utah vs League

### 3.1 Counting Metrics

![](docs/count_mammoth_gaps.png)

This figure compares Utah skaters to the league median across core box-score statistics.

**Key observations:**
- Utah underperforms the league median in overall scoring output, particularly in **points** and **plus/minus**, indicating weaker offensive production and goal differential at the team level.

### 3.2 Percentage Metrics

![](docs/perc_mammoth_gaps.png)

This figure focuses on efficiency-based metrics.

**Key observations:**
- Utah outperforms the league median in percentage-based metrics, suggesting reasonable efficiency despite lower overall volume.

To better understand the source of these team-level trends, the following sections examine forwards and defensemen separately.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. Forward Group Analysis

### 4.1 All Forwards: Counting Metrics

![](docs/forwards_gaps_counts.png)

This analysis isolates forwards (C, L, R) to examine offensive production without defensive dilution.

**Key observations:**
- The only counting metric in which Utah forwards underperform is **plus/minus**.
- Metrics such as shots, goals, and points show stronger performance relative to the team-level comparison, suggesting that forwards are not the primary source of Utah’s overall scoring deficit.

### 4.2 All Forwards: Percentage Metrics

![](docs/forwards_gaps_percentages.png)

**Key observations:**
- There are no substantial differences between Utah forwards and the league median in efficiency-based metrics.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 5. Position-Specific Analysis

### 5.1 Centers (C)

![](docs/C_counts.png)  
![](docs/C_percentages.png)

**Key observations:**
- Centers underperform the league primarily in **plus/minus**, with no meaningful deficits in other metrics.

### 5.2 Left Wings (L)

![](docs/L_counts.png)  
![](docs/L_percentages.png)

**Key observations:**
- Utah’s left wings outperform the league only in **faceoff win percentage**.
- Shot volume for left wings is well below the league median, and the limited number of shots taken converts inefficiently.
- Among all positions, **left wing appears to be the clearest area of need**, particularly in generating offensive opportunities.

### 5.3 Right Wings (R)

![](docs/R_counts.png)  
![](docs/R_percentages.png)

**Key observations:**
- Utah right wings perform above the league median in nearly every metric except faceoff win percentage, indicating strong overall contribution from this position group.

### 5.4 Defensemen (D)

![](docs/D_counts.png)

**Key observations:**
- Utah defensemen stand out primarily in **penalty minutes**, suggesting a more physical or aggressive style of play.
- However, defensemen underperform in **plus/minus**, indicating potential issues in preventing scoring chances.
- Shot production from defensemen is closer to the league median than for centers and is comparable to right wings.
- Percentage-based metrics are excluded due to negligible differences in shooting percentage and missing faceoff data.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 6. Ice Time vs Production

![](docs/scatter.png)

This scatterplot examines the relationship between **shots** and **plus/minus** for left wings.

- Gray points represent league players
- Red points represent Utah Mammoth players

**Key observations:**
- Utah left wings cluster at low shot totals and lower plus/minus values, reinforcing earlier findings that this position group struggles to generate offense and positively impact goal differential.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 7. Summary and Takeaways

### 7.1 Strengths
- Utah performs well in **faceoff win percentage**, **shot generation**, and **goal scoring**.
- Centers and right wings generally exceed league median performance.
- Defensemen perform close to league average in most metrics.

### 7.2 Weaknesses
- Left wings significantly underperform across most metrics.
- Plus/minus remains a persistent weakness across multiple position groups.
- Defensive performance suggests issues with suppressing opponent scoring.

### 7.3 Roster Implications
- Using the accompanying Streamlit application and filtering for forwards, several players were identified who perform above league average without representing top-tier salary commitments:
  1. Kirill Kaprizov  
  2. Jake DeBrusk  
  3. Patrik Laine  
  4. Nick Paul  
  5. Lucas Raymond  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 8. Limitations and Next Steps

**Limitations:**

- Median values do not capture elite, top-end talent.

- The league baseline includes Utah players.

- Contextual factors such as usage, teammates, and competition are not modeled.

**Next steps:**

- Exclude Utah from the league baseline.

- Normalize performance gaps using percentages or z-scores.

- Incorporate advanced metrics such as expected goals (xG).

- Add player age data to analyze performance across career stages.
